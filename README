This is a test for a JavaScript graphical filter editor, created by me (Carlos Rafael
Gimenes das Neves - @carlosrafaelgn, carlosrafael.prog at gmail dot com), based
on my old C++ graphic equalizer. Check out the source for more information!

This test uses the new Web Audio API and requires the latest version of Chrome
or Safari (WebKit).

If running the equalizer from a local file, Chrome must be started with the
command-line option --allow-file-access-from-files otherwise you will not be
able to load any files!
