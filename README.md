GraphicalFilterEditor
=====================

This is a test for a JavaScript graphical filter editor, based on my old C++ graphic equalizer. Check out the source for more information!

This test uses the new Web Audio API and requires the latest version of Chrome (or any other compliant browser).

If running the equalizer from a local file, Chrome must be started with the command-line option --allow-file-access-from-files otherwise you will not be able to load any files!
