GraphicalFilterEditor
=====================

This is a test for a JavaScript graphical filter editor, based on my old C++ graphic equalizer. Check out the source for more information!

For usage sample, please, check out my site's source (in English): http://carlosrafaelgn.com.br/GraphicalFilterEditor

This test uses the new Web Audio API and requires the latest version of Chrome (or any other compliant browser).

If running the equalizer from a local file, Chrome must be started with the command-line option --allow-file-access-from-files otherwise you will not be able to load any files!
